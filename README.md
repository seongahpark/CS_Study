## 진행방식
1. 대 주제 1 - 소 주제 2 정해서 이론 마크다운 파일로 금요일까지 깃허브에 업로드 (제가함)
<대 주제 목록 : 컴구, OS, DB, 네트워크, 소공, 디자인패턴, 자료구조 등등..>
2. 각자 스터디 후 인당 총 질문 3개 준비해오기
사다리타기해서 자기 다음 순서 사람이 준비해온거 질문해주기
*질문 준비해올 때 꼬리질문 준비해오기, 메인 질문자 이외 다른 사람도 꼬리질문하기 가능
*스터디 중 좋은 자료 있다면 마크다운 수정해서 업로드 부탁드립니다*
3. 답변에 대한 질문자의 피드백
4. 각자 받았던 질문 및 꼬리질문 정리해서 깃에 업로드
